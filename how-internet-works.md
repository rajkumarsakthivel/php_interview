How Internet Works
Basically the Internet is a client (server) and buyer (Client) communication. This is related to the Internet Protocol TCP / IP. The following events can take place for a purchase.

Identification will be given as XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with numbers for each computer on the Internet. This is the IP number. Since this type of digital man is difficult to handle, the 'spacekeeper' is used to refer to the number. The Domain Name System is a file that accesses the file on the Internet with the text.


The layered domain name system is organized into zones, each served by a name server.
Buying refers to a cycle.

From a corner of the world to the user, the poster is posted (eg, a single resource locator) [e.g. : http://ta.wikipedia.org/w/index.php]
The browser also searches for the temporary reminder of the IP number that is installed on the computer in the installed system. The software that is usually called Nameserver is called.
The host file is handled here. This will be in the / etc / hosts (GNU / Linux) or C: \ Windows \ System32 \ drivers \ extra \ hosts (Microsoft Windows). If this file does not have a digit number, the browser will be looking for a closer computer to the computer.
Internet service providers called ISP will play here, and the ISP will act as a group or group and solve the text as a number.
Nameserver is a way through the ta.wikipedia.org website, 208.80.152.2 to the browser. The domain name is known as the domain name system.
The browser will now attempt to contact the server with 208.80.152.2 addresses.
Next will be 208.80.152.2 GET w / index.php is the command that HTTP / 1.0 generates. This command will be converted to packets.
The sender address, the recceiver address, and the port (the computer) (Port) are mentioned in the foreground. The fields are usually the following.

GET / wiki / Internet HTTP / 1.1
Host: ta.wikipedia.org
User-Agent: Mozilla / 5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv: 5.0) Gecko / 20100101 Firefox / 5.0

Participants will accept the playing field and give them the router.
The router segments get in touch with other routers and add the GW (index / index.php HTTP / 1.0) to the host from the user's browser in the 208.80.152.2 number.
Prepare a host file and send it to the Internet in the wiki / wiki.
Accept-Encoding: Gzip, a DATAGRAM, can be used to get the gzip file that you can handle and transfer the internet file to gzip.
The following data will be sent to the buyer.
HTTP / 1.0 200 OK

(Where Firefox / 5.0 gzip will download the file and send it to Gecko / 20100101, the headquarters of the buyer.
Gecko / 20100101 will provide the receipt of the receiver to the receiver of the receiver, along with the file supplied by http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd.
Finally we have a website that has a link.
